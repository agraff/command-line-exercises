Sambucus (elder or elderberry) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Adoxaceae.
It was formerly placed in the honeysuckle family, Caprifoliaceae, but was reclassified due to genetic evidence.
It contains between 5 and 30 species of deciduous shrubs, small trees and herbaceous perennial plants.
The genus occurs in temperate to subtropical regions of the world.
More widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, its Southern Hemisphere occurrence is restricted to parts of Australasia and South America.
Many species are widely cultivated for their ornamental leaves, flowers and fruit.[2]
The leaves are pinnate with 5–9 leaflets (rarely 3 or 11).
Each leaf is 5–30 cm (2.0–11.8 in) long, and the leaflets have serrated margins.
They bear large clusters of small white or cream-colored flowers in late spring; these are followed by clusters of small black, blue-black, or red berries (rarely yellow or white).
